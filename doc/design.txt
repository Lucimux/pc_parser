Python is going to be the first output language, so that AQA
style Pseudo code can be converted into first-cut python
for further development. This will be useful for school children
to develop the basis of an algorithm in pseudo code, and then
convert this into Python to further develop it.

JUST DONE
Written runtime for arrays.
Written runtime for readline/writeline

TODO
Add assignment to the Array class, so that the initialiser can be implemented

a = [1,2,3,4,5]

becomes:

a = Array(1,2,3,4,5)

Then __init__ uses *args and just initialises elements from those.
If none, then inner array is empty on start.
