Design of a grammar suitable for use with PLY.
First cut grammar with rough notes...

Notes
- no explicit string expressions in their grammar?
- but can assign string literals to variables
- no obvious way to concatenate strings
- userinput accepts numbers and strings
- output accepts numbers and strings

Python is going to be the first output language, so that AQA
style Pseudo code can be converted into first-cut python
for further development. This will be useful for school children
to develop the basis of an algorithm in pseudo code, and then
convert this into Python to further develop it.

JUST DONE
Tested nested if/for/else, seems to be ok.

TODO

need a runtime for readline (what opens, seeks, reads and closes the file?)
need a runtime for writeline (what opens, seeks, writes and closes the file?)

need a runtime for array expansion (sparse arrays)
  a[x][y] = 4

  if a is not defined as a [][] there is a problem
  if a is not big enough for [x][y], will get undefined error on write
  (read error is ok)
  So we need an auto-expanding list runtime
