Design of a grammar suitable for use with PLY.
First cut grammar with rough notes...

Notes
- no explicit string expressions in their grammar?
- but can assign string literals to variables
- no obvious way to concatenate strings
- userinput accepts numbers and strings
- output accepts numbers and strings

Python is going to be the first output language, so that AQA
style Pseudo code can be converted into first-cut python
for further development. This will be useful for school children
to develop the basis of an algorithm in pseudo code, and then
convert this into Python to further develop it.

JUST DONE
yply strips out curly braces on embeds
Resolved IF ambiguity

TODO
finish rest of backend
