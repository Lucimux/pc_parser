Design of a grammar suitable for use with PLY.
First cut grammar with rough notes...

Notes
- no explicit string expressions in their grammar?
- but can assign string literals to variables
- no obvious way to concatenate strings
- userinput accepts numbers and strings
- output accepts numbers and strings

Python is going to be the first output language, so that AQA
style Pseudo code can be converted into first-cut python
for further development. This will be useful for school children
to develop the basis of an algorithm in pseudo code, and then
convert this into Python to further develop it.

JUST DONE
Most of backend now implemented.

TODO
Array initialisation woudl benefit from using a list rather than a string
parameter definition, same
parameter passing, same

If a procedure has no statements, must put "pass" in it to be valid python
(same with function)
(same with for loop)
(same with while loop)
(not necessary for repeat loop as it has a break in it)

build a case expression stack, so that the presently parsing case statement
knows what expression to put in the if statement

Remember the number of case expressions on the stack, so we know if to generate
if, or elif
