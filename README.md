# pc_parser
A simple pseudo-code parser

Inspired by this:

https://github.com/gbaman/Python-To-AQA-Pseudocode

and looking at this:

http://filestore.aqa.org.uk/subjects/AQA-GCSE-COMPSCI-W-TRB-PSEU.PDF

I decided to use this:

to build something that would turn Pseudo Code into real code.

(It's a component of a bigger project, but pretty much a stand-alone
implementation)
